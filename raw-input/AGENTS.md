# raw-input Working Rules

This folder is for temporary research capture used to draft or update docs.

## Purpose

- Store raw notes, quick summaries, and source collection output.
- Distill content into committed docs under `docs/`.
- Preserve original external URLs exactly when promoting references.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not commit raw note files from this folder.
- Keep only durable, curated references in `docs/references.md`.
- Prefer primary or official sources when available.
- If a source is low-trust or anecdotal, place it under "Community Case Studies (Use with Caution)" in `docs/references.md`.

## Sorting Workflow

1. Capture findings in a local `raw-input/*.md` note.
2. Extract unique URLs and de-duplicate.
3. Move durable links into `docs/references.md` with clear sectioning.
4. Summarize insights into the appropriate docs page (for hooks: `docs/05-tool-guides/hooks.md`).
5. Keep wording concise and tool-agnostic unless a section is explicitly tool-specific.

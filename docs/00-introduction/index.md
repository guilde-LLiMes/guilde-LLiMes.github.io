- [Why Guidelines Matter](why-guidelines-matter.md) — the cost of not having project context for your LLM
- [What Makes a Good Guideline](what-makes-a-good-guideline.md) — dense, scannable, unambiguous, actionable
- [Tool Landscape](tool-landscape.md) — CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, AGENTS.md
- [Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — how to contribute through issues and PRs with the project quality bar
